I am currently employed as a penetration tester for The Commonwealth Bank and enjoy keeping things secure. Previously I was a software developer at Bankwest, working primarily on all things release automation, with a focus on Infrastructure as a Service.

Outside of security and release automation I have a big interest in web development and functional programming and enjoy talking at length on these topics. Most recently I spoke about [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) at [DDD Perth](https://dddperth.com/).

### Other Work

On the side myself and another developer build and maintain a competency assessment application called [Assessmate](https://www.assessmate.com.au/). Originally developed for the Murdoch University School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Assessmate provides an easy-to-use solution for assessing the skills and capabilities of students.
